# Carnegie 30-Day Chart

### The Guide to Practicing [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034)

This is a simple static page that provides a chart with which you can practice
the skills taught in *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. If you haven't read this book,
I highly recommend it.

The chart is built on a 6 week program where you practice certain skills
5 days of out of each week. Each week is categorized in some way, and
each skill in Carnegie's book is listed at least once, with the one's I considered most important occuring up to 4 times.
Brief descriptions are given for each skill, as well as descriptions as to what each week is intended to cover.

The chart uses Foundation for the grid-style design, and light jquery for some of the link handling.

Feel free to hack on if you want to update the design, descriptions, or functionality. Or
if you have read the book as well and make suggestions to the chart body.
