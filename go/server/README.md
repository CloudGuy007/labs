# Go Web App Server

A basic server written in Go to act as a wiki.

Navitate to '/edit/any_path' and you will be prompted with a form to create a
short wiki. After saving you will be able to view that wiki page at
'/view/any_path'.

Data is persistant - currently in files.

TODO: Move persistant data to be stored in db.
