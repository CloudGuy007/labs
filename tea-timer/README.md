[The Societea](http://thesocietea.org)

This is a repo housing the PHP/JS code I used to build a site that
offers 4 tea timers for all of your tea-steeping needs. Built in
conglomeration with the [The Societea Tea
Chart](http://labs.thesocietea.org/tea-chart), there are 9 types of teas
covered in this chart:

### Tea
* White
* Green
* Yellow
* Oolong
* Black
* Pu-erh

### Tisanes
* Rooibos
* Yerba Mate
* Other Herbal

The tea timers also account for multiple steepings, and therefore
provided different times based on steeping - as well as an alert if
certain steepings are unavailable. Recommended water temperatures are
also provided.

All suggested steeping times and water temperatures are in accordance
with recommended Western Style steeping practices.

These tea timers are very lightly based on the [Cyborg Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg)
and also utilize basic customized color themes. Please fork and contribute
if you would like, or just use it as a reference.
